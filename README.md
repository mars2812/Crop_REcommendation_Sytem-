# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System

A **Machine Learning–based Crop Recommendation System** that suggests the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and environmental conditions. This project helps farmers and agriculture enthusiasts make **data-driven decisions** to improve crop yield and sustainability.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Choosing the right crop is crucial for maximizing agricultural productivity. This system uses a trained **Machine Learning classification model** to recommend crops based on key parameters such as:

* Nitrogen (N)
* Phosphorus (P)
* Potassium (K)
* Temperature
* Humidity
* pH value of soil
* Rainfall

The application takes user input and predicts the **best suitable crop** for cultivation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)**
* **Pandas & NumPy**
* **Flask / Streamlit** (Web Interface)
* **HTML & CSS** (UI Design)
* **Git & GitHub** (Version Control)

## 🚀 How the System Works

1. User enters soil and climate parameters
2. Input data is passed to the trained ML model
3. Model predicts the most suitable crop
4. Recommended crop is displayed on the UI
